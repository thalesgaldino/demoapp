# Image Search using Flicker API
Built on top of React Native sample(Vanilla version)

# Set up requirements

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

> Install `yarn` as the dependencies were installed with it. Xcode version was 14.3.1

> Open `src/SearchContainer.tsx` file and add you flickr api key

## Install dependencies and run pods

```bash
yarn install

cd ios && pod install
```

## Prepare to run: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Known issues

1. SearchContainer render test fails because we run into an issue with `@gluestack-ui` lib
2. Icons are not working with `gluestack-ui` lib, open issue here: https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg/issues/2101
3. The search result list doesn't ensure merge of a list of unique items because when loading the next page, there's no check on whether the item has moved between pages and therefore an item might come in 2 pages, even after merge. This can affect the recycling of the list which would have caching issues. One work around would be replacing the array with a hashmap
4. Api key should be in a environment file, so we don't store it on the repo by mistake
5. Fail case UX should be handled better, right now is silent in terms of user interface

## Suggestions for next Immediate Improvements

1. Strings could be using i18n
2. There's no assurance the images sizes are appropriated
3. Increase test coverage

# Troubleshooting

1. If you come across `xcrun error: SDK "iphoneos" cannot be located` while installing pod, fix it running: `sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app`
2. in case you have issues with dependencies caching, try `yarn clear:all`

If you can't get this to work, see the [Troubleshooting](https://reactnative.dev/docs/troubleshooting) page.
